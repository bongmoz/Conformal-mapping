# Conformal-mapping
This repository contains the coefficients of the conformal mapping used in my research paper.
L=100, M=60.

Section 4.xlsx contains the mappings used in Section 4.
Section 5.1.xlsx contains the mappings for the tunnels without interlayer used in Section 5.1.
Section 5.2.xlsx contains the mappings used in Section 5.2.
Section 5.3 part1.xlsx contains the mappings for the tunnels with interlayer used in Section 5.3.
Section 5.3 part2.xlsx contains the mappings for the tunnels with interlayer used in Section 5.3.

Each column corresponds to each scenario. 

For the mappings of the ground, each row corresponds to $C_{-100}$ to $C_{1}$.
For the mappings of the initial liner, the isolation interlayer and the secondary liner, each row corresponds to $C_{-60}$ to $C_{60}$.
